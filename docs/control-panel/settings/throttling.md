# Access Throttling

**Control Panel Location: `Settings > Access Throttling`**

This section of the Control Panel allows you to manage the Throttling feature. See [Throttling Control](optimization/throttling.md) for more information regarding this feature.

## Settings

### Enable throttling?

Allows you to enable or disable this feature.

### Require IP?

Set the system to deny a visitor access if the user's IP address cannot be determined while throttling is enabled.

### Maximum page loads

The total number of times a user is allowed to load your web pages (within the time interval below) before being locked out. For example, if you set this preference to 5 page loads within 10 seconds, a user can not browse more than 5 pages within a 10 second interval or the throttling feature will be triggered, locking them out of your site according to the parameters you set below.

### Time interval

The number of **seconds** during which the above number of page loads are allowed.

### Lockout time

The length of time in **seconds** that a user will be unable to use your site.

### Lock out action

The action that should take place if a user has exceeded the limits. The options are:

- `Send 404 headers`: This option will cause standard server 404 Page Not Found headers to be sent.
- `URL Redirect`: This option will send the user to a URL of your choice.
- `Show custom message`: This option will display a custom message you can specify.

### Redirect

If you choose the `URL Redirect` option above, this preference enables you to set the destination URL.

### Message

Set a custom message to show throttled visitors. Throttling must be enabled and `Action to Take` must be set to `Show custom message`.
