# Word Censorship

**Control Panel Location: `Settings > Word Censorship`**

This section of the Control Panel allows you to enable word censoring. It is also where you define the list of censored words.

## Settings

### Enable censorship?

You may enable or disable word censoring. If you select "Yes", the system will replace any specified words in channel entries, comments, forum posts, etc. according to your preference below.

### Replacement characters

You may optionally specify a word or phrase to be used when replacing censored words. For example, if you set "tisk tisk" as your replacement word, and "shucks" is in your censored list, then anytime "shucks" is used it will be replaced with "tisk tisk". If you do not set this preference, a pound symbol will be used for each character that is censored, so "shucks" would be converted to "\#\#\#\#\#\#".

### Words to censor

Specify a list of words to censor. Wildcards are allowed. For example, `test*` would censor the words "test", "testing", and "tester", while `*gress` would censor the words "progress" and "congress".
