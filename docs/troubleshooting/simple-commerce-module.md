# Troubleshooting Simple Commerce Module

[TOC]

## IPN not being recorded by Simple Commerce Module

When testing the Simple Commerce module sometimes the IPN gets sent by PayPal but the Simple Commerce module does not record it.

### Troubleshooting IPN

Confirm these settings:

- Both buyer and seller are verified.
- Buyer is logged in to ExpressionEngine when purchasing.
- The email address in the Simple Commerce module matches that entered into PayPal. This is case sensitive.
