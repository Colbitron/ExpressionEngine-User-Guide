# Comment Subscriptions

[TOC]

## Comment Notification Links Tag

The `{exp:comment:notification_links}` tag can be to allow members to subscribe to an entry without commenting via a simple link. This tag may only be used on a single entry page.:

    {exp:comment:notification_links}
      {if subscribed}
        <h5><a href="{unsubscribe_link}">Unsubscribe to comment notification for this entry.</a></h5>
      {if:else}
        <h5><a href="{subscribe_link}">Subscribe to comment notification for this entry.</a></h5>
      {/if}
    {/exp:comment:notification_links}

Comment notification links will only show on a single-entry pages, such as "comment" pages.

NOTE: **Note:** Only logged in members may subscribe without commenting. The tag will return nothing for non-logged in members.

NOTE: **Note:** If your URL does not contain the entry ID or url_title, you must use either the `entry_id=` or `url_title=` parameter on your `{exp:comment:notification_links}` tag.

## Comment Subscriber List Tag

The Comment Subscriber List Tag enables you to display the members who have subscribed to comment notifications for a particular entry.

NOTE: **Note:** The Comment Subscriber List Tag is intended for use in one of your "single entry" pages. That is, a page that shows a single, specific channel entry. Its variables are all prefixed, so you can easily use it inside of a channel entries tag or a comment entries tag.

Here is a basic example showing how you might use the Comment Subscriber List Tag:

    {exp:comment:subscriber_list}
      {if subscriber_count == 1}
        <p>{subscriber_total_results} Subscribed</p>
        <ul>
      {/if}

      {if subscriber_is_member}
        <li><a href="{path='member/{subscriber_member_id}'}">{subscriber_screen_name}</a></li>
      {/if}

      {if subscriber_count == subscriber_total_results}
        <li>and {subscriber_guest_total} Guest{if subscriber_guest_total != 1}s{/if}</li>
        </ul>
      {/if}
    {/exp:comment:subscriber_list}

## Parameters

[TOC=3]

### `entry_id=`

    entry_id="24"

You can hard code the comment subscriber list tag to show subscribers for a specific channel entry by its entry ID.

NOTE: **Note:** This parameter takes precedence over any entry specified dynamically in the URL, so when using this parameter you will want to make sure it is clear to the user which entry the displayed comments belong to.

### `exclude_guests=`

    exclude_guests="yes"

If you would like to exclude guest comments from the list and totals, set the _exclude_guests_ parameter to "yes". Comments made by non-members will not be included in the totals, and their email addresses will not be available for output to Super Admins.

## Variables

[TOC=3]

### `{subscriber_count}`

The "count" out of the current subscriber being displayed by the tag. Also available simply as _{count}_, but using the prefixed version makes this variable safe to use inside of other tags that may have their own _{count}_ variable.

### `{subscriber_email}`

The email address of the subscriber being displayed.

NOTE: **Note:** For the privacy of your site's members, email addresses will **only** be output to logged in Super Admins. This is useful for making this information known to administrators, e.g.:

    {if subscriber_is_member}
        {subscriber_screen_name}
    {if:else}
        {encode="{subscriber_email}"}
    {/if}

`{subscriber_email}` will be empty if you are not logged in as a Super Admin so it is best to use this variable in a conditional.

### `{subscriber_guest_total}`

The total number of subscribers to an entry who are **not** registered members of the site.

### `{subscriber_member_id}`

The member ID of the subscriber being displayed. This will be "0" if the subscriber is a guest, so it is best to use this variable in a conditional.

### `{subscriber_member_total}`

The total number of subscribers to an entry who are registered members of the site.

### `{subscriber_screen_name}`

The screen name of the subscriber. This will be empty if the subscriber is a guest, so it is best to use this variable in a conditional.

### `{subscriber_total_results}`

The total number of subscribers to an entry. Also available simply as `{total_results}`, but using the prefixed version makes this variable safe to use inside of other tags that may have their own `{total_results}` variable.

## Conditionals

### `{if subscriber_is_member}`

The conditional allows you to show (or hide) content based on whether the subscriber is a registered member of the site.
