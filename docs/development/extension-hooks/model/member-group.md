# MemberGroup Model Extension Hooks

[TOC=3]

### `before_member_group_insert($member_group, $values)`

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                   |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| \$member_group | `Object` | Current MemberGroup model object              |
| \$values       | `Array`  | The MemberGroup model object data as an array |
| Returns        | `NULL`   | void                                          |

Called before the member group object is inserted. Changes made to the object will be saved automatically.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('before_member_group_insert', $this, $this->getValues());

### `after_member_group_insert($member_group, $values)`

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                   |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| \$member_group | `Object` | Current MemberGroup model object              |
| \$values       | `Array`  | The MemberGroup model object data as an array |
| Returns        | `NULL`   | void                                          |

Called after the member group object is inserted. Changes made to the object object will **not** be saved automatically. Saving the object may trigger the save and update hooks.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('after_member_group_insert', $this, $this->getValues());

### `before_member_group_update($member_group, $values, $modified)`

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                      |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| \$member_group | `Object` | Current MemberGroup model object                 |
| \$values       | `Array`  | The MemberGroup model object data as an array    |
| \$modified     | `Array`  | An array of all the old values that were changed |
| Returns        | `NULL`   | void                                             |

Called before the member group object is updated. Changes made to the object will be saved automatically.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('before_member_group_update', $this, $this->getValues(), $modified);

### `after_member_group_update($member_group, $values, $modified)`

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                      |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| \$member_group | `Object` | Current MemberGroup model object                 |
| \$values       | `Array`  | The MemberGroup model object data as an array    |
| \$modified     | `Array`  | An array of all the old values that were changed |
| Returns        | `NULL`   | void                                             |

Called after the member group object is updated. Changes made to the object will **not** be saved automatically. Calling save may fire additional hooks.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('after_member_group_update', $this, $this->getValues(), $modified);

### `before_member_group_save($member_group, $values)`

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                   |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| \$member_group | `Object` | Current MemberGroup model object              |
| \$values       | `Array`  | The MemberGroup model object data as an array |
| Returns        | `NULL`   | void                                          |

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('before_member_group_save', $this, $this->getValues());

### `after_member_group_save($member_group, $values)`

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                   |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| \$member_group | `Object` | Current MemberGroup model object              |
| \$values       | `Array`  | The MemberGroup model object data as an array |
| Returns        | `NULL`   | void                                          |

### `before_member_group_delete($member_group, $values)`

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                   |

| Returns        | `NULL`   | void                                          |

Called before the member group object is deleted. If you are conditionally deleting one of your own models, please consider creating an [inverse relationship](development/services/model/relating-models.md#inverse-relationships) instead. This will provide better performance and strictly enforce data consistency.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('before_member_group_delete', $this, $this->getValues());

### `after_member_group_delete($member_group, $values)`

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                   |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| \$member_group | `Object` | Current MemberGroup model object              |
| \$values       | `Array`  | The MemberGroup model object data as an array |
| Returns        | `NULL`   | void                                          |

### `before_member_group_bulk_delete($delete_ids)`

| Parameter    | Type    | Description                                     |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| \$delete_ids | `Array` | The primary key IDs of the models being deleted |
| Returns      | `NULL`  | void                                            |

Called before a bulk of member group objects are deleted. If you need to do an expensive operation when member groups are deleted, it may be more efficient to handle it in bulk here.

How it's called:

    ee()->extensions->call('before_member_group_bulk_delete', $delete_ids);

TIP: **New in version 4.3.0.**

### `after_member_group_bulk_delete($delete_ids)`
